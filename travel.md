# Stories
It's often hard to think of one on the spot, but they come up in conversation upon relevant topics. Care to hear one? Ask me about the time I: 
- crashed a Mongolian birthday party in Ulaanbaatar
- ran out of gas in-the-middle-of-no-where Alaska
- rode a taxi like a horse in Beijing during Spring Festival
