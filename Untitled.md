**Classic**

- ● [Chena Hot Springs](https://chenahotsprings.com/)

- ○ THIS IS THE PLACE TO WATCH THE NORTHERN LIGHTS FROM, but you probably already heard of it. 
- ○ Jump in the snow, then jump in the hot tub. It’s fun, trust me. Also, when you’re in the rock pond, your hair and eyelashes will get all frosted up, super cool. 

- ● [World Ice Festival](https://www.explorefairbanks.com/event/world-ice-art-championships-2023/6326/) 

- ○ This may not be happening when you are there, I think it’s in February, but there will be lots of ice carvers there preparing their pieces.
