    <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>

<p>A small step forward, a giant leap for mankind… That’s what I read on the urinal today, at least.</p>

<h1 id="email-to-supporting-friendsfamily">Email to Supporting Friends/Family</h1>

<p>I haven’t forgotten about sending pictures from my trip around China</p>

<p>This is my way of doing social media</p>

<p>I’m inspired by homesteading on the internet, digital gardens and want to contribute to making the indie web. This is my contribution. Welcome.</p>

<p>Let me know if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you would like to be removed from this list</li>
  <li>what I write about helps you or someone you know in any way, it will inspire me to keep documenting</li>
</ul>
