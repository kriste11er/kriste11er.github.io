    <p>Note to Motorcycle Mechanic:</p>

<p>I was riding home two nights ago (9PM, ~60F) and the bike wouldn’t start after riding 20 minutes and pausing at a corner store. The next morning it started fine and worked all day. Then riding home last night, just after getting a full tank of gas in the afternoon, the engine cut out while riding (10PM, ~65F). I’m thinking it’s likely an air or fuel problem. I tried priming the fuel pump a few times to see if it would start, no luck. I tried starting while the fuel pump was priming and it started up but died down as soon as the pump finished priming. </p>

<p><strong>History of Maintenance:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>July 2022: replaced front tire, air filter, spark plugs, fuel filter and pump, coolant flush </li>
  <li>September 2023: replaced chain with front and rear sprockets </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Maintenance:</strong> 
Additionally, I’d like to get an overall general check by a professional mechanic. Some things I’m noticing: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The engine occasionally makes a sort of knocking sound when I first start it</li>
  <li>The engine sounds different than a year ago. It sounds dry or has a more rattling feel to it. </li>
  <li>Brake lines check (had to bleed a bit during chain installation to separate calipers) </li>
  <li>It doesn’t coast well, there’s a lot of friction in the rear wheel system. When I replaced the chain, there is now a rubbing sound when rolling the rear wheel forward, but not when rolling backward (might be a wheel bearing issue?). </li>
  <li>New cotter pin for rear wheel axle</li>
  <li>Check front sprocket washer and torque</li>
</ul>

Got all the tools from Harbor Freight and Advanced Auto Parts. Parked it in an inconspicuous place behind a Stop n Shop. Let’s go.</p>

Due to the symptoms, the likeliest problem was pointing towards a blocked fuel filter. I forgot that the fuel filter is built into the fuel pump assembly on this model. I also had replaced this with a new unit last summer (July 2022), and this filter doesn’t look too bad.</p>

Air filter looks dirty, but replaced it summer of last year. Should be good for more miles. Still has good oil coverage.</p>

Sprawled out everywhere in the back of a commercial zone parking lot.</p>

This is what the air suction valve looked like right after taking it off. Had to buy a small socket wrench set from Harbor Freight right before they closed to be able to get torque on this at the weird angle required. There was some oil residue on the reeds but not as bad as summer last year when it was choking itself due to too much oil in the engine.</p>

Another angle to see how the reeds are stuck to the surface of the air suction valve body.</p>

Here’s what it looks like cleaned with electronic cleaner spray.</p>

Pardon the language, it was a late night and I really wanted it to work.</p>
