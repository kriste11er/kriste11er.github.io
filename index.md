Hello! Welcome to my digital garden!

# Jaguar Kristeller

I am a designer, project manager, systems thinker, and mechanical engineer. I graduated from MIT in 2016 with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering concentrating in Robotics, Instrumentation, and Controls. 


TECHNICAL EXPERIENCES

Please see my resume. 


MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCES

As a consultant just out of college, I successfully led a design review of 5 stakeholders in Beijing for a tethered helium balloon attraction to pass safety inspection by Chinese Special Equipment Inspection engineers. After joining a team that had made multiple costly, unsuccessful trips to China for inspection reviews, my streamlined approach met with immediate approval.

While in China, I led a student team to design and construct a wooden rollercoaster inside the International School of Beijing. We focused on alternative teaching methods. Within 4 months, we navigated the school's bureaucracy for project approval, taught relevant physics and engineering, and guided the design and build process for a successful completion exactly on time for the school’s Innovation Exposition. We kept morale high throughout the build despite several setbacks.

I taught myself conversational Chinese within 3 months. Now, after 5 years of studying through immersion and textbooks, I am socially fluent. I thrive in foreign environments, learn quickly, and find my footing. When I see the path from technical details to feasible large-scale implementation, like the leading path of a lightning strike, I can be a confident, charismatic, empathic leader. For example, I managed the R&D for an emergency medical delivery drone service in rural Sonora, Mexico. We started work before sunrise each day until we achieved a successful full-stack test of an autonomous mission with package deployment. When I truly believe in something, I imagine it, and it becomes reality.


CURRENT FOCUS 

I'm currently looking for work opportunities in energy transition, climate tech, or biotech/neuroscience robotics to develop my project management and engineering technical skills. 

While sending out applications, I'm reviewing and teaching myself the curriculum of three MIT classes: 
- Advanced Controls (State Space Method)
- Compliance Mechanisms
- Modeling and Simulation
