Hello! Welcome to my digital garden!

# Jaguar Kristeller

I am a designer, project manager, systems thinker, and mechanical engineer. I graduated from MIT in 2016 with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering concentrating in Robotics, Instrumentation, and Controls. 


TECHNICAL EXPERIENCES

Please see my [resume](https://www.kriste11er.com/202309_Jaguar-Kristeller.pdf), technical presentation example (coming soon), and engineering drawing example. 


MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCES

As a consultant just out of college, I successfully led a design review of 5 stakeholders in Beijing for a tethered helium balloon attraction to pass safety inspection by Chinese Special Equipment Inspection engineers. After joining a team that had made multiple costly, unsuccessful trips to China for inspection reviews, my streamlined approach met with immediate approval.

While in China, I led a student team to design and construct a wooden rollercoaster inside the International School of Beijing. We focused on alternative teaching methods. Within 4 months, we navigated the school's bureaucracy for project approval, taught relevant physics and engineering, and guided the design and build process for a successful completion exactly on time for the school’s Innovation Exposition. We kept morale high throughout the build despite several setbacks.


CURRENT FOCUS 

I'm currently looking for work opportunities in energy transition, climate tech, or biotech/neuroscience robotics to develop my project management and engineering technical skills. 

While sending out applications, I'm reviewing and teaching myself the curriculum of three MIT classes: 
- Advanced Controls (State Space Method)
- Compliance Mechanisms
- Modeling and Simulation
